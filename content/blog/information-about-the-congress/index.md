Dear participants,

all of our lectures and events will take place on ZOOM. You will receive an email a few hours before the lectures which will contain the necessary links for all the lectures for that day. If by any chance the link doesn't work for you, meeting ID and passcode will also be provided. After clicking the link we will let you in on the meeting as soon as possible and you will be able to watch the entire program. 

Also, in case you have any question during the talks, you can write them down in the chat, and if in any case, you don't want everyone to see your question or comment, there is an option to send it to the organisers only. 

We kindly ask you to check your devices and test ZOOM so that you minimise the probability of having technical difficulties during the talks. We especially implore active participants to test every aspect of ZOOM's screen sharing option and don't forget to turn on the option to share your device's audio, which is particularly important if you have videos included in your presentation. 

You can find the final programme for the congress attached to one of our recent emails, or on our website under <a href="https://neuri.uniri.hr/en/documents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Documents</a>.

In case you have any further questions, contact us.
