Dear colleagues,\
\
our next lecture is Protein aggregation in major mental ilness by Nicholas Bradshaw, PhD.\
\
Who is Nicholas Bradshaw ❓\
\
➡️ Nick is a native of the UK (now also naturalised Croatian), who studied for his undergraduate degree at Durham University, before working on his PhD at the University of Edinburgh, under the supervision of Dr. Kirsty Millar and Prof. David Porteous. There he began his research into proteins involved in the biology of schizophrenia and depression, which he has been studying in one way or another since. He travelled to Düsseldorf in 2011 with a postdoctoral fellowship from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, where he began to look specifically at the role of protein aggregation in the laboratory of Prof. Dr. Carsten Korth at the Heinrich Heine University. In 2017, he moved to the University of Rijeka, where he is now teaching at the Department of Biotechnology as an assistant professor and head of studies in English, as well as leading his young research team. His research continues to focus on proteins involved in the pathology of major mental illness, using a variety of cellular and molecular techniques, as well as biochemistry. Nick is currently funded by a project from the Croatian Science Foundation.
