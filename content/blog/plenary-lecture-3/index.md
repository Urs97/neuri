Dear colleagues,

our next lecture is Brain Machine Interfaces: From Basic Science to Neuroprostheses and Neurological Recovery by Professor Miguel Nicolelis, MD, PhD.

Who is Professor Nicolelis ![❓](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t4c/1/16/2753.png)

![➡️](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t9e/1/16/27a1.png) Miguel Nicolelis, M.D., Ph.D., is the Duke School of Medicine Distinguished Professor of Neuroscience at Duke University, Professor of Neurobiology, Biomedical Engineering, Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychology and Neuroscience, and founder of Duke's Center for Neuroengineering. He is Founder and Scientific Director of the Edmond and Lily Safra International Institute for Neuroscience of Natal. Dr. Nicolelis is also founder of the Walk Again Project, an international consortium of scientists and engineers, dedicated to the development of an exoskeleton device to assist severely paralyzed patients in regaining full body mobility. Dr. Nicolelis has dedicated his career to investigating how the brains of freely behaving animals encode sensory and motor information. As a result of his studies, Dr. Nicolelis was first to propose and demonstrate that animals and human subjects can utilize their electrical brain activity to directly control neuroprosthetic devices via brain-machine interfaces (BMI). Dr. Nicolelis’ pioneering BMI studies have become extremely influential since they offer potential new therapies for patients suffering from severe levels of paralysis, Parkinson’s disease, and epilepsy. Dr. Nicolelis is a member of the French and Brazilian Academies of Science and has authored over 200 manuscripts, edited numerous books and special journal publications, and holds three US patents. He is the author of Beyond Boundaries: The New Neuroscience of Connecting Brains with Machines and How It Will Change Our Lives; The Relativistic Brain: How it Works and Why It Cannot Be Simulated by a Turing Machine; and The True Creator of Everything: How the Human Brain Shaped the Universe as We Know It.
